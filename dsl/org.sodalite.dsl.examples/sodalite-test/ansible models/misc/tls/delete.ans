//this is the model of the playbook defined here: https://github.com/SODALITE-EU/iac-modules/blob/master/misc/tls/playbooks/delete.yml
playbook_name: "misc/tls/delete"
//PROBLEM: the node type sodalite.nodes.TLS.Certificate, that should use this playbook, is missing in the rm examples
//therefore the "used_by" attribute won't be used in this model, so there won't be any connection to any TOSCA input
